# AI Powered Knowledge Engine for Smart Support and Ticket Resolution

## Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that helps support teams resolve tickets faster by providing intelligent, context-aware responses based on a knowledge base.

## Key Components

### 1. Knowledge Base Management
- Document ingestion and processing
- Text chunking and vectorization
- Storage in vector database

### 2. Ticket Processing
- Ticket classification and categorization
- Similarity search for relevant knowledge
- Context-aware response generation

### 3. AI Integration
- Google Gemini for content generation
- LangChain for orchestration
- Vector similarity search

### 4. Database
- SQLAlchemy for structured data
- Vector storage for embeddings

## Architecture
```
User Ticket → Preprocessing → Vector Search → Context Retrieval → AI Generation → Response
                ↓
        Knowledge Base (Documents + Embeddings)
```

## Features
- Automatic ticket categorization
- Intelligent knowledge retrieval
- Context-aware response generation
- Support for multiple document formats
- Scalable vector search
- Response quality scoring

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up environment and dependencies
2. Create knowledge base ingestion system
3. Implement vector search functionality
4. Build ticket processing pipeline
5. Integrate AI response generation
6. Add response quality evaluation
7. Create user interface
8. Testing and optimization
